	# something simple and clean

	# The goal is to return the string 'foo' if a number is divisible by 3, return the string 'bar'

	# both 3 AND 5, and return False otherwise

	# this is an implementation of the Bridges of Konigsberg problem.  Don't be intimidated by this one
	# if you don't just think of an answer, it's legitimately a hard problem, it's a problem
	# Euler figured out over a few days, whhich would mean it would be pretty ridiculous to expect
	# a mortal to do it, except for the fact you get somethign Euler didn't have: A computer

	# It goes like this.  There are 4 islands, and seven bridges, each bridge connecting some island to another
	# can you write a program to verify if it's possible to walk these bridges, each once, but NEVER more than once
	# and ending on the island you started.  The test will include the arrangement of bridges in the original 
	# famous problem, but naturally the goal will be to write a program that could solve it for many setups
	# just return true or false, about whether it can be done
